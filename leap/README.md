Hey Guys, I’m going to move when I send out the challenge to Wednesday, so I’ll have another one for you then. In the mean time, this should be a really quick one

#Leap Years
Write a program that determines if a given year is a leap year.
Leap years occur:

* Every four years
* Except if that year is divisible by 100
* Unless that year is divisible by 400

For example, 1992 was a leap year, 1900 was not a leap year and 2000 was a leap year. For a more thorough explanation as to why, see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX96xng7sAE.
